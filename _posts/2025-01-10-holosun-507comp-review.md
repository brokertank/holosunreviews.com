In this in-depth review, we'll explore the [Holosun 507Comp](https://limitedoptics.com/products/holosun-hs507comp/), a standout product from a brand that has become synonymous with quality and affordability over the last decade. We take a closer look at how this optic revolutionizes both competitive and defensive shooting scenarios through its innovative features.

## Introduction to the Echelon and 507Comp Synergy

The Springfield Echelon has quickly become my go-to pistol for range days due to its distinctive and superior features, making it a formidable player in the polymer striker-fired market. However, my interest in pairing it with a reflex optic like the Holosun 507Comp was piqued by the Echelon's innovative Variable Interface System (VIS). After a sneak peek at an industry trade show, I knew the 507Comp was the optic to test on the Echelon.

## The 507Comp's Impressive Optics

One of the first things you notice about the Holosun 507Comp is its expansive **1.1” x 0.87” objective lens**. This large window offers a clear, bright view without the bulk, making target acquisition seamless and efficient. 

- **Competition Reticle System (CRS)**: The 507Comp introduces the CRS, which includes a red or green dot and four reticle options: a 2 MOA dot, 8 MOA circle, 20 MOA circle, and 32 MOA circle. This flexibility allows shooters to tailor their sight picture to their shooting style or the specific demands of a competition.
  
- **Design and Durability**: Crafted from 7075 T6 aluminum, this optic not only promises durability but also fits the industry-standard footprint for easy installation. It features Holosun's Shake Awake technology for energy efficiency.

- **Battery and Brightness**: With a CR1632 battery providing up to 50,000 hours of life, the side-mounted battery tray adds convenience for replacements. The optic boasts eight daylight and two night vision brightness settings, ensuring visibility in any light condition, with an IP67 waterproof rating for durability in harsh environments.

## Mounting and Performance

Mounting the 507Comp onto the Echelon was straightforward, thanks to the VIS, requiring only the included screws—no adapter plates needed. This setup allowed for a perfect co-witness with the Echelon's tritium three-dot sights, enhancing precision.

- **Range Performance**: At the range, the 507Comp shone with its clear, crisp reticle. The combination of the 2 MOA dot with the 8 MOA circle was particularly effective for rapid target engagement. Adjustments were intuitive, with the optic holding its zero through various drills. 

- **Brightness Adjustments**: In Arizona's bright desert light, the 507Comp's brightness settings were more than adequate, preventing any washout and providing clear visibility even against light backgrounds.

## Shooting Experience

During testing, the 8 MOA ring combined with the 2 MOA dot proved to be my favorite setup, offering quick reacquisition post-recoil. Although the 20 MOA ring was also beneficial for tracking, the 8 MOA's balance of speed and precision was unmatched for my shooting style. The 32 MOA circle, while not my personal preference, would certainly appeal to those favoring larger target frames.

## Conclusion: A Robust Choice for Handgun Enthusiasts

After firing 250 rounds at distances from 15 to 50 yards, the 507Comp not only maintained its zero but also complemented the Echelon's performance exceptionally. Priced at $435 for the red dot version and $470 for green, the 507Comp is a cost-effective alternative to pricier optics like the Trijicon SRO or RMR while delivering top-tier performance.

## Final Thoughts

I'm eager to continue testing this optic and pistol combination through more rigorous scenarios. For now, the pairing of the Echelon with the Holosun 507Comp has proven to be a match made in shooting heaven. If you own an Echelon or are in the market for a high-quality, versatile red dot sight, the 507Comp is definitely worth considering.
